## Briefly write about the project that you have submitted from the perspective of the user.
*The project I submitted is a web-based form creation and response management system. As a user, I can create custom forms with various question types such as text, dropdowns, checkboxes, file uploads, and sliders. The process allows me to easily add questions and configure their settings. After creating a form, I can share it with others to gather responses.

Once the form is filled out by respondents, I can view the collected data in an organized way, with responses displayed in a table format. The system provides analytics for different question types, including text analytics for open-ended questions and selection counts for multiple-choice questions, allowing me to analyze the responses effectively.

Additionally, the system ensures smooth interaction by providing a simple and intuitive interface for creating, responding, and analyzing forms, all while maintaining a clean, mobile-friendly design.*

## Assumptions you have made for this project?
*Mention ALL assumptions you have made for this project. If none, specify so.*

## Other information (like testing credentials)
*None*

## Did you learn anything new while doing this assignment? Please explain.
*Through this assignment, I learned more about Django and SQL, particularly how to work with models, handle form submissions, and interact with databases using Django's ORM. I gained practical experience in dynamically creating forms, processing user responses, and displaying analytics. I also learned about template rendering and SQL queries in Django, which enhanced my understanding of how Django handles data and builds web applications.*

## How much time did it take for you complete the project?
*Approx 4-6 hrs*

## If you had more time, what enhancements will you make?
*If I had more time, I would enhance the project by improving the user interface with modern UI frameworks, adding user authentication for personalized responses and form tracking, and implementing conditional question logic for dynamic forms. I would also enhance the analytics dashboard with interactive visualizations, introduce email notifications for form submissions, add multi-language support, and improve file handling for better upload capabilities. These enhancements would create a more efficient, user-friendly, and feature-rich application.*
